Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Fidel Niyidukunda
ðŸŒŸ Aspiring Developer | SQL Enthusiast | SEO Explorer | Into Health and Fitness ðŸ’ª

About Me
A master of none, student of all! Iâ€™m fascinated by the ever-advancing world of Information Technology, and Iâ€™m on a quest to contribute at higher levels in the dev industry. Whether itâ€™s crafting elegant code, optimizing websites for search engines, or building robust networks.

What I Love:
Web Development: I thrive on turning ideas into functional websites. From simple HTML/CSS/JS based static 3-page sites, combining Bootstraps code to make effortlessly responsive-mobile first websites, or fully dynamic and interactive sites with WordPress. Check out Del IT&Web (https://www.delitweb.com/) to see my work in action!

SQL: Data is King in this era, no doubt! I have discovered a new love for data representation, management and security, among other things and i aspire to be fluent in the language of databases. From querying data to designing schemas, I envision SQL as my trusty sidekick.

SEO: Iâ€™m on a mission to make websites dance gracefully in the spotlight of search engines. Meta tags, backlinks, and content optimizationâ€”itâ€™s all part of the magic.

IT Networking: Networks are the digital highways connecting our world. Iâ€™m passionate about configuring routers, troubleshooting complex issues, and ensuring seamless communication. We're talking OSPF,RSTP, Wlan technology and other modern tools used in today's networking to improve communication, security and resilience.
